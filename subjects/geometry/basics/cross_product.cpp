/*

    The idea of cross product is to describe a operation that outputs a vector from other two

    This outputed vector has some properties. 
        - It needs to be orthogonal to both input vectors
        - Its norm is numerically equal to the area of the parallelogram created from the input vectors
        - Its norm is defined by |A||B|sin(Î¸)
