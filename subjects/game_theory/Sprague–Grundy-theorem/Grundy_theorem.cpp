    Grundy generalizes the strategy from the game nim to every other game that fulfil the following

    Two players move alternately. 
    The game consists of states, and the possible moves in a state do not depend on whose turn it is. 
    The game ends when a player cannot make a move. 
    The game surely ends sooner or later. 
    The players have complete information about the states and allowed moves, and there is no randomness in the game.

    So, to deal with grundy numbers. We need to understand the following.

    To calculate the grundy number of a number we need to do the following

    g_s = mex({g1, g2,â€¦, gn})

    Where g1, g2, .., gn are the grundy numbers of the states to which we can move.
    By the way mex({}) = 0.
